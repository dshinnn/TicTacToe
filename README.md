<h2>About</h2>
    This school project demonstrated the practical usage of programming using the material we have learned thus far during the semester.

<h2>Goal and requirements</h2>

<strong>Goal:</strong> To simulate a game of Tic-Tac-Toe with no errors

<strong>Requirements: </strong> Simulate a game of Tic-Tac-Toe with two players.  Player1 always starts first and uses the X while Player2 uses O.  The first player to connect three in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins.  Otherwise if the board is full and no one has connected three in a row, it is a draw.

<h2>Key learnings</h2>

- Practical practice of programming
- Vectors

<h2>Testing</h2>

1. Download or copy the code in the main.c
2. Import it in a C++ IDE or use an online source (https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler)
3. Run the code

<h2>Project status</h2>
